  description: >
    The goal of this project is to observe and analyze speech variations in psychiatric disorders by analyzing different types of data including ecological momentary assessments, recordings of clinical interviews, and social media posts.
    Key questions we hope to answer are: 1) Is speech a good longitudinal biomarker? 2) How much speech information is needed for stable tracking? 3) Can linguistic information augment voice models? 4) Can we create a neurocomputational model of such systems?

  description: >
   This is a collaboration with the <a href="http://genus.mgh.harvard.edu/">Genus
   Consortium</a> to apply multivariate data mining and visualizatin tools to
   the GENUS dataset. An additional target is to support data harmonization in
   multi-site studies. Key questions are: 1) Do multivariate deterministic and
   probabilistic tools provide a more sensitive approach to detecting genetic
   markers of brain structure and cognitive variation? 2) Can a common
   vocabulary help organize and analyze multi-site data?

  image: ../images/undraw_medicine.png
  description: >
   The aim of this project is to harness both genetic and brain imaging data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study 
   and the UK Biobank in order to design models that predict disease risk from genes and brain endophenotypes. 
   The project will explore to what extent incorporating intermediate phenotypes that are more closely tied to biology 
   and may capture environmental effects increases predictive ability compared to polygenic risk scores alone, 
   and what additional insights can be gained with this method (eg. new loci discovery, better mechanistic understanding, delineation of new disease subtypes).

  image: ../images/Vocallect Image.png
  description: >
    The purpose of this study is to understand and classify the impacts that communication disorders may have on speech production and acoustic quality. Subjects
    will respond to questions regarding their current health, and provide sample voice recordings and free and read speech through a smartphone application and/or 
    web browser. By collecting and correlating self-reported symptoms with audio features, we intend to develop and validate a voice-based technology using signal
    processing and machine learning that can be used for in-hospital and in-home monitoring of communication disorders, treatment, and recovery.
